Welcome to Flatpak's documentation!
===================================

These docs cover everything you need to know to build and/or distribute applications as Flatpaks. They contain a high-level introduction to Flatpak, tutorials on building applications and essential information on how to develop and distribute applications as Flatpaks.

The docs are primarily intended for application developers and distributors. However, they might be interesting if you are interested in Flatpak more generally.

If you are looking for information about how to install and use Flatpak applications, please refer to `the Flatpak website <http://flatpak.org>`_. Otherwise, if you want information about Flatpak internals or how to create runtimes, the `Flatpak wiki <https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/wiki>`_ is the best place to start.
